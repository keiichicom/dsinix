An operating system for dsx86.nds for Nintendo DS /DS Lite /DSi XL / DS Lite

dsx86.nds by Patrick Aalto can be downloaded from here: https://dsx86.patrickaalto.com/ .
Put it in your ROMS folder. I use TwilightMenu++ by Rocket Robz

Download the repository and put it in the root of your sd card verbatim.
I setup the data folder for you.

Start dsx86.nds and when the dos prompt loads, run the dos program dsinix.com, type help for help.

Notes: The beep command emits really short low volume tone.
       To return to the shell from graphics mode after entering the icon command press ESC.
       Some stuff is faked, since this is a proof-of-concept release.
