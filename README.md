2025-12-18 Added real ls command with paging, added clear command.

Download DSx86.nds by Patrick Aalto from here: https://dsx86.patrickaalto.com/ .
Put it in your ROMS folder. I use TwilightMenu++ by Rocket Robz. I already put the dsx86.ini file in the data folder for you.
Download 4DOS from the same link. I already made the 4DOS directory for you: /data/dsx86/4DOS.

Download the repository and put it in the root of your sd card verbatim.
I setup the data folder for you.

Start dsx86.nds and when the dos prompt loads, run the dos program dsinix.com, type help for help.

Notes: The beep command emits a really short low volume tone.
       To return to the shell from graphics mode after entering the icon command press ESC.
       Some stuff is faked, since this is a proof-of-concept release.
