; Example configuration file for DSx86. Edit this to your preferences!
;
; This file should be either in /data/dsx86/ directory or in the root
; directory (not recommended) on your SD card.
;
; First section should be called DSx86. This contains the global
; configuration options. Currently the only option is the directory
; and name of the crash log file on your SD card. Please send the
; contents of this file to patrick@patrickaalto.com if/when DSx86
; drops into a debugger. The log file grows until deleted so you can
; first collect the info from all your favourite games before
; sending the combined log file to me.

; Next should be the "default" section, which will be used whenever
; a game does not have a specific section. Each section can have
; configuration for screen scaling mode ("ZOOM", "SCALE", or "JITTER"),
; screen update mode ("DIRECT", "60FPS", "30FPS", "15FPS"), and key
; mappings.
; 
; Currently only the MCGA graphics mode uses this setting, all the
; other modes always use DIRECT mode regardless of the configuration.
; In DIRECT mode the NDS VRAM is updated directly, in the other modes
; a virtual screen RAM is copied to NDS VRAM every XX fps.
;
; Each section can also have key mappings. The key mappings map an
; NDS key to a PC keyboard hardware key number. By default KEY_A = Enter,
; KEY_B = Space, and DPAD keys are the cursor keys.
